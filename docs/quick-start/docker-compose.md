# docker compose quick start

You can turn an [app sim config](../specification/README.md) into a docker compose
file using the [docker compose generator](../../scripts/generators/docker-compose/).

The generator is available as docker image and you can retrieve it by running

```shell
docker pull cisco-open/app-simulator-generators-docker-compose:latest
```

To try it out, create the a file called `config.yaml` with the following content
in a new folder:

```yaml
services:
  frontend:
    type: java
    port: 3000
    endpoints:
      http:
        /upload:
          - http://processing/magicByte
          - http://processing/virus
  processing:
    type: java
    endpoints:
      http:
        /magicByte:
          - cache,128
        /virus:
          - http://virus-scanner/scan
  virus-scanner:
    type: nodejs
    endpoints:
      http:
        scan:
          - sleep,1500
          - call: error,500,Scan failed
            probability: 0.1
          - sleep,500
loaders:
  user-1:
    type: curl
    wait: 0
    sleep: 2
    urls:
      - http://frontend/upload
      - http://frontend/upload
      - http://frontend/upload
```

To generate a `docker-compose.yaml` from this file run

```shell
docker run --rm -t -i --v ${PWD}:/mnt cisco-open/app-simulator-generators-docker-compose --config /mnt/config.yaml --output /mnt/docker-compose.yaml
```

Review the `docker-compose.yaml` generated and then run the simulation via:

```shell
docker compose up
```

This will bring up the three services (`frontend`, `processing` and `virus-scanner`) and a loader (`user-1`). Run `docker ps` to verify that all
services are up and running:

```shell
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                                   COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                            NAMES

```

The loader will continuously load from the `/upload` endpoint. You can also reach that endpoint yourself, either by opening <http://localhost:3000/upload>
in the browser or by running the following:

```shell
curl http://localhost:3000/upload
```

The `docker-compose.yaml` that was generated now works independent of the generator. You can use it wherever you want and you can modify it
to your needs.

If you want to learn more about app-simulator and how you can use it for your own needs, we recommend that you continue with the [tutorial](../tutorial/1-two-java-services.md).
